    "The SVM model demonstrated a 90% accuracy in predicting loan repayment status.The confusion matrix revealed that the model was better at identifying loans likely to default than those likely to be fully paid, and this is likely a reflection of the data used.  The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's performance; \n",

    "This model excelled at identifying loans likely to default but struggled with those that would be fully paid. When predicting the outcome for a new loan with an $80 installment, 7.5% interest, and a 725 FICO score, the model predicted a default. This suggests that individuals with these financial characteristics may be at higher risk of defaulting on their loan."
